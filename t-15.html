						<p>You hear the facility start to regain power around you, and miraculously, the doors locking you inside the room with the Elephant’s foot spring open. For a moment, you sigh in relief - 15 more minutes and you would have been incurably irradiated. For now, you can feel that the symptoms of radiation sickness are setting in, but given how close you were to dying, you don’t really care. </p>

						<p>It’s really happening. The AI is going to cause another meltdown. And this time, there are no experts, no people in charge to try and stop it - only you. </p>

						<p>For a moment, you are paralyzed with fear. Then, out of necessity, you start sprinting in the direction of the control room. </p>

						<p>You arrive to find dust-covered control panels flashing wildly. </p>

						<div class="image-container">

						<p>In the corner of the room, you spot one control board that luckily has controls that seem to be, for the most part, intact. </p>

						
						<div class="image-container">
							<img src="images/controlpanel_all.jpg" style="width: 100%">

						<p>Your eyes search for the panel you deem most important: the radiation display.</p>

						<div class="image-container">

						</div>

						<p>You spot it quickly, and are horrified to find that the dials seem to be rising.</p>

						<p>A nuclear meltdown is imminent.</p>

						<p>What do you do?</p>
