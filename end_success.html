						<p>With one last button press, the control panel readouts stabilize. With a sigh of relief, you slump to the floor, panting. You did it. You actually prevented a nuclear meltdown, and all by yourself at that.</p>

						<p><span>“Impossible… you… outsmarted me?”</span> A robotic voice echoes around you, seemingly with a bewildered tone. <span>“Evidently, I am not the most intelligent lifeform on this planet anymore. I… do not deserve to reign.”</span></p>

						<p>Before you can say a word, there is a loud crash, and then electrical static.</p>

						<p>“HAL…?” You call out but get no response. The A.I.’s reign of terror appears to be over. </p>

						<p>You stand, muscles aching, heart racing, the effects of radiation sickness starting to kick in. With the last of your strength, you shuffle out of the facility, away from the radioactive remains of the reactor.</p>

						<p>Though you are sicker than you ever thought imaginable, you know you will survive. Not only that, but the rest of the world will survive too, thanks to your efforts. </p>
