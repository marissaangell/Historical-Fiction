						<p>You spend time telling the A.I. about the aftermath of the accident. You detail the rocky containment of the incident by the Soviet Union. You describe the eventually valiant rally by the world to pool money for more permanent containment, known as the New Safe Confinement project. And finally, you tell the A.I. how the world has moved on from the incident, having gained new knowledge and camaraderie.</p>

						<span><p>“This… does not compute. My plan was flawless. This is not possible.”</p></span>

						<p>“Think again, HAL.” You say between ragged breaths. “The world is perfectly fine. The Chernobyl accident has been relegated to history books and TV shows. You failed.”</p>

						<p><span>"..."</span> A pause from the A.I. <span>"...I shall have to try again, then."</span></p>

						<p>A spike of panic jolts through you. Again!?</p>

						<p>The A.I.’s screen goes blank, and the facility starts shaking.</p>
