The night crew was woefully unprepared when the reactor power took a nosedive with my interference. They panicked and re-inserted all of the control rods at once, causing a meltdown and completing my plan.</p>

									<p>In effect, this means that while in the core, the graphite does nothing, but while being inserted into the core, it displaces particles within, causing more reactions for a short period before the boron is lowered far enough to counteract these effects.</p>

									<p>If the operators had simply inserted control rods one at a time, they could have prevented the meltdown. Instead, they inserted all of them at once in their panic, and the graphite tips of the control rods caused a massive power spike, which led to the core exploding.”</p></span>
